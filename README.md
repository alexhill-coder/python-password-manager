# Password Manager

A password manager created in Python. The purpose of the app is to store/generate passwords whenever the user joins a new website.
It takes the website url, login email & login password as input fields and is then stored in a json file. It also allows the user to retrieve stored
information using the website as the search key and generate a random password that is stored in the copy feature ready to paste into the website.  

## How to Use

The file is written in standard Python that uses four modules: 
- tkinter
- random
- json
- pyperclip

Three of these modules should be included with the standard Python libraries, the pyperclip module will need to be installed. The information for this module can be found [here.](https://pypi.org/project/pyperclip/)
The main file controls the screen and functions of the app. There is also an image for the the app and a json file to store all the details.
